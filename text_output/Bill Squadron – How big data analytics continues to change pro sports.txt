will people do like to talk about Big Data today and I'm not sure anybody knows exactly what they mean when they say it because historically people have always been interested in getting as much information as they can in order to base decisions and road maps on good good information that's nothing new I think the difference in the reason people do talk about Big Data today is that our ability to collect much more extensive information data about people behave your activity and so forth is far greater so the notion of big really means big in that sense I mean we suddenly have these massive volumes of new data that didn't exist before so that you know we do know how many people click on an adult or we do know with much more specificity how many people are choosing a particular path for transportation you know another option because we just have the ability to collect that in much more scientific ways in sports to give you an example we now have whole categories of data that didn't exist before so whereas before we had been able to say is fastball looks like around 100 Mi an hour we now know not only that it's 97 miles an hour but that it moved and cross the plate in exact location where the velocity the location 30 times a second from the moment it leaves the pitcher's hand and all of that data can be used to monitor if a picture is losing their steam if a picture is changed in terms of their delivery from a prior year and this is happening every sport in the NFL this year they'll be putting a chip on players and tracking every movement you'll be able to know exactly how fast it back reacts when the balls when you have these new massive data sets and sports is just one example because that kind of data in different ways applies to every industry there's a natural inclination to want to use it in ways that can add value to the corner adding value to the company that wants to sell a product to people who are you know clicking in different ways around the internet you have to analyze the data and of course one of the major one of the major changes that accompanied the existence of all the states is the emergence of more sophisticated data mining tools so you put these things together and suddenly you have a whole industry building
