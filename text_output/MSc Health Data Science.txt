information technology has completely changed the landscape of Healthcare in recent years and there are now vast electronic resources of information that can be used for health research Health Data science is a rapidly developing discipline that aims to use these resources as effectively and efficiently as possible to answer medical research questions and as a result it leans very heavily on skills such as mathematical modeling of statistical techniques machine learning and computer programming in the MSC in health data science LS HTML you'll be giving a thorough grounding in all of the skills and techniques with the name that you emerge from the course as competent data scientists but of course is all about health and so there's a great emphasis upon skills such as epidemiology which will need in order to form meaningful research questions and to be able to interpret those results correctly you're also gain a thorough grounding in some of the sensitivities and requirements that relate specifically to Patient related data about the range of individuals who need to communicate your findings to this may be other data scientists it will be clinicians laboratory Specialists but most importantly it will also involve communicating your findings to the patients who are directly involved an affected by the work that data scientists are trying to do one of the things that makes the course lshtm unique is that this is a truly Global institution we have staff working in over 100 countries and we have an extremely diverse staff and students and this is reflected in the teaching that we do in the nature of the research that you carry out and in the external collaborators who you'll have the opportunity to work with over the course of the year so what are we looking for in terms of student applications and you may have an undergraduate degree in computer science or statistics or you may come from a slightly different experience it's important that you would understand the basics in linear algebra calculus and probability and you would have some parts exposure to programming and that could be programming from language such as we look forward to receiving your application please get in touch if you have any questions and hopefully we'll see you in September
