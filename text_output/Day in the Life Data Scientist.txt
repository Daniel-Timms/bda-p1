we live in a world where technology is Advanced so that we can collect huge amounts of data the human mind does not have the ability just to look at tables and tables of data and just draw some conclusions so data science is logical way of being able to identify the structures that are inherent in that data understanding the business problem doing the analytics and then providing some sort of a solution my name is Alina curbelo and I'm a data scientist at Chevron data science is an interdisciplinary approach for extracting information out of data in order to make better decisions the team of data scientists is pretty diverse one there are people that come from maybe the more traditional background they have statistics degree or computer science degree but then there are people that come about it from the other way of having a deep knowledge of the subject matter is beautiful because the relationships and the way that it could be used to solve problems and all these different areas I always say that data science is about more than just data scientists we're working with people to help answer their questions give them information that we can from their data that involves developing training materials actually giving the training and then perhaps working with people one-on-one to identify what they need to do to build their schools in that area one of the things I like to do when I'm teaching is to take technical Concepts from the class and then tie them to things that people might be more familiar with in their everyday lives I use some examples from construction there's a lot of engineering and creating a garment you have a flat pattern and you've got to think of how to construct it in a three-dimensional way data science takes data and tries to find patterns in the data to answer questions the data comes from a variety of sources it could be from the instant investigation and Reporting it could be from reliability databases and inspection records maintenance records and then also operating data the kind of problems that I work with are trying to improve process safety and so that's helping us be more proactive rather than reactive I'm excited about the future of data science at Chevron is gaining a lot of momentum I think there's a lot of data and we're starting to get to dig into it and try to get some insights and I'm really excited to see where it takes us
