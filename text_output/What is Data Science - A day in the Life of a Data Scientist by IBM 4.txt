I built a recommendation engine before as part of a large organization and worked through all types of engineers and accounted for different parts of the problem it's one of the ones I'm most happy with because ultimately I came up with a very simple solution that was easy to understand from all levels from the executives to the engineers and developers ultimately it was just as efficient as something really complex that I could have spent a lot more time on University we have a problem that we wanted to predictions with engineering background so we use artificial the public transit is operated by Toronto transformation of the largest authorities in in in in in in in in the region in North America and when did they contacted me and said we have a problem and it's okay what's the problem we have complaints data and we would like to analyze it and we need your help I said find out very happy to help so I said how many complaints do you have they said a few I said how many maybe half a million I said well let's let's start working with it so I got the data and I started analyzing it so basically they have done a great job of keeping the data and some data in table for that was unstructured data and in that case table of data was when the complaint was arrived who received it what was the type of the complaint was it resolved whose fault was it and the other part of it was the exchange of emails and factors to imagine looking at how many million exchanges of emails and trying to get some answers from it so I started working with it and I the first thing I wanted to know is why would people complain and is there a patron is there some days where they are more complaints than others and I looked at the data and I analyzed it in all different formats and I couldn't find what the impetus for complaints being higher on a certain day and lower on others and it continued for for maybe a month or so and then one day I was getting off the bus in in Toronto and and I was still thinking about it and I stepped out without looking at the ground and I stepped into a puddle puddle of water and now I was sort of ankle deep into water and it was just one foot wet and the other guy and I was extremely annoyed and I was walking back and I then it hit me and I said well wait a second today it rained unexpectedly and I wasn't prepared for it that's why I'm wet and I wasn't looking for it what is what if there is a relationship between extreme weather and the type of complaints TTC receives so I went to the environment Canada website and I got data on rain and precipitation wind and the light and there I found something very interesting the 10 most excessive days for complaints the 10 days with people complain the most what the days when the weather was bad was it was unexpected rain in Extreme drop in temperature too much snow very windy today so I went back to the ttc's executives and I said I've got good news and bad news it's a good news is I know why people would complain excessively on certain days I know the reason for it the bad news is there's nothing you can do about it
