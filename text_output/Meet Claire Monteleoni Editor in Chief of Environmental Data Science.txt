the achievement I'm most proud about is pioneering a new research field called climate informatics machine learning for the study of climate change I collaborated with a climate scientists and that first work Advanced the state of the art in the field of climate science one of the best paper award at a NASA conference with that momentum we started an annual event hello my name is Claire Monteleone and I'm the founding Editor in Chief of environmental data science my specialization is using machine learning in confronting and better understanding climate change in the climate informatics Community we were thinking of actually starting our own journal so when Cambridge University press approached me about this opportunity to co-develop and scope and vision what a journal encompassing environmental data science would look like that was a perfect opportunity for me the benefits of publishing in environmental data science is the high-quality peer review from both data scientists and domain experts in environmental Topics in the diffusion to interdisciplinary audience I'm excited for the future of environmental data science as it continues to build this community bringing together data scientists with people with very interesting and important and impactful environmental problems
